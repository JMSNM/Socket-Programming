In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.
Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemyâ€™s resistance without fighting.
The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.
He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
Victory comes from finding opportunities in problems.
