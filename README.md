## ðŸ“š Project Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|:------:|:--------|
| `q1/` | Distributed Sum of Integers |
| `q2/` | Distributed Prime Number Checker |
| `q3/` | Parallel Matrix Multiplication |
| `q4/` | Distributed Word Count (Coming Soon) |
| `q5/` | Distributed Sorting System (Coming Soon) |
| `README.md` | Project Overview (this file) |

Each folder will contain:

- `server.py` â€” The server script that distributes tasks and aggregates results.
- `client.py` â€” The client script that connects to the server and performs computations.
- `start_clients.py` â€” (Optional) Script to auto-launch multiple clients for testing.
